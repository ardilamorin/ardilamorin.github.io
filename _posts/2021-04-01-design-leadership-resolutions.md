## 01 Think Big and act Lean

One effective thing you can do as a “lead” is set big ambitious goals, but in order to keep everyone engaged on the goal you also have to show progress and keep momentum. Break those big goals into smaller short-term milestones that allow you to see the steps you are taking towards the big picture, and keep track of progress, celebrating small victories.

## 02 Distrust the process

See process as a way to enable great design, a common language and have the right expectations. But be ready to challenge the process, instill trust and empower your team to change it when it doesn't make sense, enabling the flexibility to react to change.

## 03 Be honest not an asshole

You have the responsibility to be honest and tell your team what they are doing wrong, its the only way they will know and be able to fix it. But there is a big difference between being honest and being an asshole. Separate the person from the work, articulate your feedback in a way that is actionable and provide challenges instead of tasks.

## 04 Show instead of tell

The best way to help others understand what you want more of, is to show them. Highlight what “good” looks like, give timely feedback that reinforces the right attitudes and use artifacts that help everyone be ont the same page.

## 05 Help others find their own answers

You don’t have to know all the answers, and even if you know the answer you should try to ask questions. People learn more when they try and find the answer themselves. It's not the most efficient way, but it will be the most powerful way to empower your team and help them grow.

## 06 Consider the person before the work

When things are not going as expected try to see the person before the work, see if there are other factors that are affecting the person that might be impacting their performance. Ask before you judge.  Take the time to know the person to be able to identify signals that might help to see the person before the work.

## 07 Don’t make promises you can't keep

In order to have influence over a group of people you have to gain their trust, and nothing has a more negative impact that not keeping your promises. Be aware of what things are under your control, stay on the safe side and be clear on the agreements you make with your team.

## 08 Share the weight

You can't do it all. Aim to give your team goals and allow for them to contribute to solving the challenges that you have as a team. Ideas generated by the team will have more traction. Make your limited time an opportunity to share the tasks and let others grow.

## 09 Embrace your critics

Ask and act on feedback. Drop your defense, be humble. You may have the right intentions and have put a lot of effort but doesn't mean it's having the expected effect. Create the space where people feel comfortable providing you feedback and calling out your mistakes.

## 10 Have tender discipline

Some things just take time, the value is not always tangible. Be nice to yourself, take breaks, motivate yourself to keep going, celebrate your small victories and trust in your ability to accomplish what you set out to do.
