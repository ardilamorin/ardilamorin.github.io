## SXSW Interactive 2017: AI, Product Design and Future Trends

![SXSW 2017 Interactive Session]({{site.baseurl}}/_posts/DSC02730.jpg)

I was lucky to attend South by Southwest 2017 thanks to [The Cocktail](https://the-cocktail.com "The cocktail website") (my current employer), a digital products consultancy in Spain. I had an idea that it was a big thing, but no idea how many people attended and the vision of the future that it would give me. So here is a summary of what I learned and the main topics from the sessions I attended, seen form a UX Designer perspective.

**First some tips**

- Buy your ticket early and save avoid queues

If you get early company approval to go, get your ticket as early as possible, enjoy an early bird discount and get a "Platinum" badge and save time getting preferred access for sessions and enterntainment that goes on afterwards.

- Housing: find a place near the conference venues

Wether you pick a five star hotel or an AirBnb shared room, be sure its close by to the conference venues, you will enjoy those extra minutes when trying to arrive early for your first session, going for change of clothes or a quick bath before a party or just walking home at night at the end of a long day. They go fast so be sure to make arrangements.

- Leave your laptop and put in some extra clothes.

Don’t take your laptop for notes, your battery won’t last a full day and you’ll be carrying the weight all day (and maybe night) while looking for power outlets. You will be sitting in small chairs crashing elbows with everyone. I recommend to use pen and paper (or an iPad) and take lots of pictures. 

Also, the weather in Austin is usually hot, but it can get colder at night, so be prepared and put a jacket in you backpack.

Now the “tech” stuff...

**Artificial Inteligence**

The main subject of the event was AI, around 60% of the sessions were about AI or had some direct relation with it. What I learned:

- It's not about tech, Its aobut the story

[The guys at Disney](http://schedule.sxsw.com/2017/events/PP96841 "Using AI & Machine Learning to Extend the Disney Magic") talked about how they embraced Artificial Intelligence, but the say is at the service of the story, and it should be invisible, it's success measured by the greatness of the story. This resonates with me, AI seen as a tool should be used only when it makes sense.

- The hard part is conversation management

Natural language processing has come a long way, but is still struggling with handling conversations. Conversation Analysis as discipline is key to get the UX right in our digital products that have Artificial Intelligence at their core. Applying the principles of conversation design: Recipient Design, Minimisation, Repair.

- Skills, Skills, Skills.

**Product Design**

Designing for humans and robots
Data is the new black
You have to tell a good story

**Trends**

Move faster...in the right direction
A new - augmented - reality
It's all about the benjamins

**Closing thoughts**
