A Linkedin group for UX professional in Madrid as a way to connect with the UX community and share knowledge.

I moved to Madrid on 2011 and didn't know much people in the city. I worked on digital products for some time, but I didn't know anyone here. I tried different ways to enter the "scene" but it didn't work out so well.

## Local events
Madrid has its fair share of local events about Design, User Experience, Customer Experience and Digital products. Here is a list of some of those in case you are interested:

- [04x10](https://vimeo.com/04x10) (No longer active)
- [Ladies that UX: Madrid](https://ladiesthatux.com/madrid/)
- [Play Restart](http://www.playrestart.es)
- [UX Academy](http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/UX-Academy/?chapter_analytics_code=UA-55896633-1)
- [UX Fighters](http://experiencefighters.com)

I attended some of these events planning to meet people, collaborate and maybe find job oportunitties in the future. Apparently most people already now each other, and after a while I noticed that there wasnt much rotation in the speakers lineup. So i stoped attending

## Other ways to network
That doesn't mean I gave up. I looked for other ways to stay in the loop and I decided to take the matter in my own hands. I did not start a "UX and Ribs" meetup, but I did create a group on Linkedin for UX professionals in Madrid. It's gaining some traction and there are some job posts from time to time but people are still a bit shy when it comes to posting.

## Join us
