Last year I joined Booking.com as a Design Manager for UX Foundations, responsible for design in Design Systems, Design Language and Accessibility. After a year, I wanted to put into words why I decided to join the company.

Booking.com is the leader of the online travel industry, with the mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. Available in 45 languages, offering services in over 220 countries around the world. But you can read all of this in booking.com website. So, what is actually interesting from a design point of view?

## The scale of the challenge

Working at Booking.com means dealing with problems at a scale that few companies in the world face. Every decision you make affects millions of users across different cultures, languages, and contexts.

> "The beauty of working at this scale is that even small improvements can have massive impact on people's lives." - Design Leader at Booking.com

When I joined, I knew I wanted to work on problems that would push me to think differently about design systems and accessibility. The opportunity to work with 150+ product teams and influence the design experience for millions of users was exactly what I was looking for.

## Building for the long term

One of the things that attracted me to Booking.com was their commitment to building sustainable systems. They weren't looking for quick fixes or trendy solutions - they wanted to build something that would serve their teams and users for years to come.

This aligned perfectly with my approach to design systems work:
- Start with solid foundations
- Build incrementally and iteratively
- Measure impact and iterate based on data
- Focus on adoption and enabling teams

## The people and culture

Beyond the technical challenges, what really makes Booking.com special is the people. I'm working with some of the smartest designers, engineers, and product managers I've ever met. The level of collaboration and knowledge sharing across teams is exceptional.

The culture encourages experimentation and learning from failure. There's a healthy balance between moving fast and being thoughtful about decisions that will impact millions of users.

## Looking ahead

After a year, I'm more excited than ever about the work ahead. We've made significant progress in transforming how design systems work at Booking.com, but there's still so much more to do.

The journey of building great design experiences at scale is never finished - it's an ongoing process of learning, iterating, and improving. And I'm grateful to be part of a team that understands and embraces that reality.
