![New Website with JekyllNow]({{site.baseurl}}/images/new-website-jekyll-now.png)*Jekyll Now*

## Technology

The first thing to stand out in this website is that it works using github pages, powered by Jekyll, a flat file website generator. You probably have heard about flat file cms, and static website generators and their advantages. Simple, fast and easy to deploy.

## Checklist for the new website

* A simple way to publish content (a blog!), and Jekyll Now offers just that.
* Decoupled theming system that allows me to change the website design without affecting the content.
* Simple hosting, since I don't need much space, database or dynamic content I didn't want to deal with web hosting services and the monthly cost.

## What's next

I hope to publish blog posts about UX design, side projects and any resources I found could be useful for the rest of the community.

So if you are reading this, let me know your thoughts.
