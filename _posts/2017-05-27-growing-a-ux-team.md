## From Junior to Senior - Growing a UX Team

As part of my role as a UX Team Lead, I was presented with the challenge to help our team grow towards Senior Consultants.

But first we needed to make clear what being a senior UX Consultant means. I personally believe that your a not "Junior" or "Senior"...you are a mix of those depending of your background. If you come from a more technical background you probably have better technical skills that help you build better products, but if you come from social studies you may have a better understanding of users, or you may have better public speaking skills that make you a better consultant being able to present your work better. So, with that in mind we did have a picture of what it means to be "Senior" in our team because of the type of work we do. We are consultants, we help companies put products that improve results in short periods of time and help them test and improve those products once they are out into the world.

So, a "Senior" in our team is a UX Consultant that is able to lead a miltidisciplinary team towards building complex products alongside the client, understanding their constraints, needs, and matching them with user needs.

The process:
- Skills assesment
- Make a plan
- The 3 dimensions formation
- The results


Skills assestment
We are a fast growing team, that means that sometimes is really hard to get the whole picture of the skills of a team member.
