Last year I joined booking.com as a Design Manager for UX Foundations, responsible for design in Design Systems, Design Language and Accessibility. After a year, I wanted to put into words why I decided to join the company.

Booking.com is [the leader of the online travel industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1039616/leading-online-travel-companies-by-market-cap/){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopenner noreferrer”}, with the mission to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. Available in 45 languages and offering services in over 220 countries around the world.  But you can read all of this in [booking.com](https://news.booking.com/fast-facts){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopenner noreferrer”}
website. So, what is actually interesting from a design point of view?

## Culture of experimentation

What was interesting for me to make the switch (beyond the impact and scale of the product) was Booking’s culture of experimentation, which I have never seen anywhere else at that scale, the number of customers and number of experiments running simultaneously. 

> Booking.com runs more than 1,000 rigorous tests simultaneously 

This culture of experimentation also entails a level of autonomy and agency that is rare at large-scale companies. Anyone can run an experiment at any time without asking for permission from management, as long as they follow certain guidelines, allowing them to learn if their idea contributes positively to the company's goals.

This means things can feel more chaotic at times, without a strong top-down mandate, but its very empowering and motivating for self-driven professionals who feel they can drive initiatives and impact from their role without necessarily needing to aspire to managerial positions.

## UX foundations

The way that booking is structured, means that being the Design Manager for UX foundations means managing design of the Design System team and the Design Language team. This is a huge opportunity to have an impact on the visual layer and empower hundreds of product teams to create cohesive experiences faster.
 Managing a mature design system - the system was started in 2019 - where the concern is not to set it up, to rush to create a ton of components, or worry about the hard philosophical discussions of how opinionated the system should be, is definitively a plus. Being responsible for the evolution of the system and taking it to the next level is a challenge I’m definitely looking forward to.

This team also is incredibly talented, has put time and effort into creating additional tools that improve the design and development workflow, and increases the quality of their work.   If you want to learn more about design systems at booking, you can checkout these talks from [Config 2024:Design System adiction](https://youtu.be/5P1CPwJdlsQ?si=bIVhFhj9Ghgo4SUc){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopenner noreferrer”} and [Config 2022: Multi-platform Design System at Booking.com](https://youtu.be/5P1CPwJdlsQ?si=bIVhFhj9Ghgo4SUc){:target=“_blank”}{:rel=“noopenner noreferrer”}.

## Design maturity and structure

Booking.com  used to be an engineer-dominated company where designers were expected to ship code to production, and reported to Product and Engineering Managers. This wasn’t every designer’s cup of tea.

Over time, the Design discipline grew to have its own structure, with representation at the top with Senior Design Directors, and with separate structures for research, writing, and UX design. This new organization allows more focus on improving the user experience and the development of design talent.

There is no separation between UX/UI designers, making everyone “Product Designers” expected to be proficient generalists (although we are internally called UX designers …which I prefer to be honest). And another benefit is that individual contributors have a clearly defined career path at the same level as managers.

It's a really good sign to see a company that has a clearly outlined career path for both management and individual contributors.

## My personal development

I feel fortunate to have worked at great places working alongside very talented people, regardless of how well-known the company was. Some of those moves were very intentional and I was lucky to land where I wanted to go. Other moves were the result of an opportunity being presented at the right time, offering benefits and learnings I wasn’t actively pursuing. 

When the chance to join booking.com came along, I jumped at it, because it represented the chance to switch to a product company, which I tried without success in the past, and was also in an area I was passionate about: Design Systems, which I firmly believe will play a pivotal role (even more than it has had up until now) in the future of how designers work.

The above are great reasons for anyone to join booking.com, but particularly I’m expecting to develop the following:

* How to evolve a mature design system from functional flexible components, to a multi-sensorial, multi-modal connected ecosystem
* How to leverage automation and artificial intelligence to optimize the use of talent in every stage of the Design Systems processes
* Establish a more solid connection between Design Systems and Design Language to elevate the user experience
* Learn and challenge the ways of working of a product company that has managed to become a leader of the travel industry

This is simply a self-reminder to make any move for the right reasons, understanding how the job you are taking contributes to your own development, regardless of titles; that you align with the company culture, where you believe that you will continue to grow and enjoy working alongside people on your team.

## How it's going

So far, the experience has been great. I'm happy to be part of a company that continous to challenge itself and allows its employees to go after new goals, not being a fraid of introducing new ways of doing things. In this time, I have worked on interesting projects like setting a baseline for mesuring the Design System's impact, defining AI guidelines for Design,and the evolution of dark mode.

I'm looking forwards to more exciting challenges in this pivotal moment of design and the evolution of how we create digital products.
