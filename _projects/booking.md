## Booking.com Design System

I led the UX foundations Design team, evolving a mature design system that powers 150+ product teams, from a reactive practice to a proactive data-informed operation that drives efficiency and enables quality at scale.

## Context

When I joined as Manager for UX Foundations, the design system team had a mature product with clear processes, but one that was reactive, lacked data to inform its roadmap and felt disconnected from the reality of product teams. This meant we weren't meeting user needs in a timely manner, and couldn't demonstrate the value provided to the company.

Product teams don't want to wait months for you to add the component they need into the system, fill out your Jira ticket explaining all possible scenarios, and get a cold rejection comment a few weeks later based on an existing component that may or may not fit their needs.

## Goal

My goal was to evolve the design system team to a proactive team, rooted on insights gathered during the interaction with our users, with clear KPIs to help communicate the impact of the team's efforts. A team that can:

- Identify major points of friction when using the Design System. Combine quantitative and qualitative metrics to inform our work. 
- Increase speed in response times without losing the human touch. Balance automation and human interaction to improve our response times and perceived quality. 
- Focus on building what increases product teams' impact. Identify high-value initiatives that would make our users' design and developer experience better. 

## Approach

In order to achieve this, I led the following initiatives.

### Time and motion study

Ran a study to evaluate the efficiency gains of our custom built Figma plugin, that helped designers identify detached components and accessibility issues before handoff.

### Revamp the education program

Introduce in-person trainings and short-form video guides "BUI Shorts" that focused on a narrow topic each time.

%}

### "System stories" initiative

Have 1:1 conversations with users of the design system to gather insights about their usage of the system, and build trust.

### AI-powered documentation

Help break the silos of internal teams and provide information faster, helping users build better solutions, leveraging AI to respond to complex user queries that would be documented across different sections.

## Results

My initiatives transformed the design system team from a reactive service to a proactive, data-driven operation:

- Established quantitative metrics that validated design tooling impact, showing 51% increase in efficiency
- Reduced response times by 60% through improved communication channels
- Increased system adoption by 42% through targeted education programs
- Built trust with product teams through "System Stories" conversations, gathering insights from 80+ teams
- Enabled faster problem-solving through AI-powered documentation, reducing search time by 70%
