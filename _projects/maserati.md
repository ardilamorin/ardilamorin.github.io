## Maserati Digital Guidelines

As part of the Platform Leads for Media.Monks, I led the UX of the creation of Maserati's digital guidelines that would inform the design and development of all of their digital touch points.

This role is a combination of hands-on work, stakeholder management and team management - player / coach - that provides direction through craft.

## Context

Maserati was on the path to transform their relationship with their customers through digital channels, wanting their online presence to reflect the emotion that their cars conveyed to their customers offline. They hired .Monks to create a holistic guidance that would inform all the websites and Apps designs in the next 3 years.

> "The Maserati brand stands for an audacious performance that we sell through an emotive reaction...It's not one that's sold on price. It's not one that's sold on value”

The previous experience was functional, but didn’t reflect the brand properly.  
  
A collection of static pictures, a rational and standard way of presenting their cars' value (horse power, speed, torque) and missing out on key elements like hand stitched leather interiors, engine sound, its Italian heritage.

## Goal

In under four months, we needed to achieve the following:

- Create a new branded experience that represented the beauty and passion of owning a Maserati, with no regression on business results
- Create a replicable way to story-tell the full lineup of Maserati vehicles in an engaging way, combining excitement with best-in-class UX.
- Transform the new experience into practical guidelines that can be used to unify the experience across touch points and inform future design and development

## Approach

The first thing we realized was that, in order to define guidelines, we needed to design what the ideal experience would look like. And, if we needed to ensure no regression on business results, we needed to validate the new solution.

> We already had proven that longer pages could be more engaging, higher converting and allowed users to explore the car's features if presented correctly.

The challenge now was being mindful about each page's role, what the user goal was and what the right level of interaction should be at that stage of the journey.

### Key pages experience design & validation

We started by analyzing the existing experience, identifying what worked and what didn't and leveraged the learnings to instill a more branded and engaging experience that went beyond traditional UX best practices.

### Experience principles

Once we knew what worked, we translated into experience principles what made the solution uniquely Maserati, serving as a more holistic guide that could be applied across channels.

### Design system

The key pages laid the foundation of what the design needed to be. We then expanded that approach to the key elements of the Maserati Apps, and broke it down into reusable components.

### Guidelines

The digital guidelines were created based on the defined experience principles. A combination of guidelines, documented best practices, and ready to use building blocks. 
  
These principles were tried and tested, ensuring that they provided an engaging experience that drove higher conversion, repeating visits, and improved brand perception.

## Results

The project showed great impact beyond just documenting guidelines, it provided a replicable formula that elevated the brand and increased conversion. In short it achieved:

- The new design not only was more on brand, but performed better in terms of user engagement and conversion.
- The rebuilt site was awarded a [Webby award for best visual design in 2023](https://winners.webbyawards.com/2023/websites-and-mobile-sites/features-design/best-visual-design-function/246815/maseraticom-redesign-and-rebuild), recognized as one of the sites setting an industry standard for excellence.
- The digital guidelines allowed Maserati to simplify operations and eliminate inconsistencies across touch points, offering a more coherent user experience across the globe.
