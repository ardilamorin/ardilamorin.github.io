## Bose.com E-commerce Experience

What might have looked like a platform migration, transformed into a company-wide digital transformation. One where UX played a key role in bringing to life a digital experience for the company's global websites, a re-brand and a new direct-to-consumer strategy.

## Context

Bose needed to modernize their e-commerce platform to compete in an increasingly competitive consumer electronics landscape, closing their physical stores and betting on a new direct-to-consumer strategy. The existing global sites were on Adobe Experience Manager, but had grown to be bloated, difficult to maintain, and didn't reflect the premium quality of Bose products.

## Goal

Migrate Bose's global websites to Salesforce commerce, going beyond a lift and shift, re-imagining the experience to enable a new direct-to-consumer strategy and introduce a new brand expression.

- Create a flagship shopping experience through direct channels
- Define and implement a new design system that would allow a seamless implementation of a new brand expression
- Enable marketing and sales initiatives that would boost revenue, average order value and overall user satisfaction when buying direct from Bose.

A key challenge was driving alignment, coordinating resources between vendors and internal teams, and repositioning the UX practice in a company where UX was perceived as "producers". 

> My goal was to transform UX from a production function to a true partner to the business, enabling the direct-to-consumer strategy and improving overall digital operations.

## Approach

I led the UX design effort across multiple work streams, partnering with strategy, marketing and engineering to bring to life the new global sites on time without negative impact to conversion.

### Roadmap definition

My team facilitated the requirements gathering for all other areas of the company, creating alignment by prioritizing features and creating a roadmap for the new experience.

### Experience Vision & UX Strategy

I oversaw the conceptualization of the new experience, a new information architecture, navigational model and definition of key features that would map to the defined requirements. I was part of a cross-functional team, supported by Accenture Song for design and Epam for development, ensuring that we met the experience requirements and the teams were delivering on the company's vision. 

Some of the key challenges to solve for were a reduced product catalog, and supporting new ways of discovering and purchasing Bose products that responded to their context of use.

### Design system approach 

With a re-brand in the works, I led the approach for the new design system, through a white label approach and pre-defined areas that could be modified without major refactoring to introduce the new brand expression once it was ready. Making the system less expressive and more rigid ensured we met our MVP timelines and facilitated the transition to the new brand.

### Solution validation and optimization

The new experience was a big change, one that was based on data and insights, but also assumptions and risks. I led a hybrid team of internal and external members, working as one cohesive group to identify, ideate and implement design solutions that would reduce friction and increase conversion.

Bose's premium segment and distinct value proposition required stepping away from standard e-commerce best practices, fostering user exploration of features and engagement over quick paths to checkout.
