I"‹<p>Finding a better way to help your team members grow, making sure they have the right challenges and what can you do to support them in the process</p>

<p>In our industry, creating digital products, professional growth and learning is determined by your formal education and experience. Experience can be a crucial factor in shaping your growth, the type of designer you will be, and finding out what is that you actually enjoy doing in our very fragmented and specialised profession.</p>

<p>As someone who has a certain level of responsibility of what projects people on my team get to do, I believe that you have to make and effort on finding the right person for the job based on the needs of the project and their skills. But (there is always a but‚Ä¶) if we only allow people to do what they are already good at, they probably won‚Äôt grow.</p>

<p>In my personal experience the projects that I‚Äôve grown the most are the ones that presented the biggest challenges, those that push you beyond what you think you are capable of doing. At the end, you push through and come out in the other side better and stronger. That process is hard, people struggle a lot, requires them to put in extra hours and could take a toll in their confidence if things don‚Äôt turn out well.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs ‚Äúsink or swim‚Äù and we have accepted it as the way people are supposed to grow, to challenge themselves, face bigger or harder tasks, pushing themselves to be better, sometimes underestimating what could happen if they can‚Äôt swim.</p>

<p>At a meeting, while discussing this subject regarding a person on our team, the magic phrase came out from one of my colleagues ‚Äújust because we had to suffer to grow doesn‚Äôt mean they have to‚Äù.</p>

<p>Then, I was able to put into words what is that we try to do every time we assign someone to a project, throwing them in the water, but making sure they won‚Äôt drown. To give them a ‚ÄúControlled growth environment‚Äù.</p>

<p>In order to do that well - provide controlled growth environment - you have to do some things first.</p>

<h3 id="understand-their-capabilities">Understand their capabilities</h3>
<p>You have to know what that person can do well, tangible things, like creating wireframes, defining the information architecture, conceptualising new solutions, creating prototypes. What others things they bring to the project, and this can be more subjective, like their ability to collaborate with others, or their stakeholder management abilities, presenting and articulating design solutions.  Additionally you have to understand what motivates them, where would they like to grow, and what‚Äôs their idea of a good project, are they better on short or longer projects, do they need supervision, what‚Äôs their preferred way of communication.</p>

<h3 id="growth-trajectory--personal-phase">Growth trajectory / Personal Phase</h3>
<p>For most people, you what their capabilities are if you work long enough with them. But one thing that we should also consider is how are they in that particular moment on a professional and personal level.</p>

<p>The growth trajectory refers to how they feel about the kind of work they want to do: are they eager to tackle a new challenge, or are they coming of a big hard project and prefer something different. Are they looking to grow towards management roles or they love their craft and are happy with refining it further.</p>

<p>On a personal level, we should be aware of what is going on in their life that could impact their performance. Moving houses, sick relative, hard breakup, newborn. How we are in our lives impacts our work more than we know.</p>

<p>But even doing your best as a manager, knowing your team and what motivates them is not enough. Most times we depend on what projects come in and who is available at that time, starting a process that I call: resourcing Tetris.</p>
