I"æ<p>A Linkedin group for UX professional in Madrid as a way to connect with the UX community and share knowledge.</p>

<hr />

<p>I moved to Madrid on 2011 and didn‚Äôt know much people in the city. I worked on digital products for some time, but I didn‚Äôt know anyone here. I tried different ways to enter the ‚Äúscene‚Äù but it didn‚Äôt work out so well.</p>

<p><strong>Local events</strong></p>

<p>Madrid has its fair share of local events about Design, User Experience, Customer Experience and Digital products. Here is a list of some of those in case you are interested:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://experiencefighters.com">UX Fighters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I attended some of these events planning to meet people, collaborate and maybe find job oportunitties in the future. Apparently most people already now each other, and after a while I noticed that there wasnt much rotation in the speakers lineup. So i stoped attending</p>

<p><strong>Other ways to network</strong></p>

<p>That doesn‚Äôt mean I gave up. I looked for other ways to stay in the loop and I decided to take the matter in my own hands. I did not start a ‚ÄúUX and Ribs‚Äù meetup, but I did create a group on Linkedin for UX professionals in Madrid. It‚Äôs gaining some traction and there are some job posts from time to time but people are still a bit shy when it comes to posting.</p>
