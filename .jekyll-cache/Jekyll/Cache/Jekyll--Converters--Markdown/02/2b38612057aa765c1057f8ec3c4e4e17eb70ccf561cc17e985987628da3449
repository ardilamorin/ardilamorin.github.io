I"v<p>It’s live! and no, it’s not done, it’s not perfect but it’s live, and as any website it is a living thing that will continue to evolve and change in time.</p>

<p><strong>Technology</strong></p>

<p>The first thing to stand out in this website is that it works using github pages, powered by Jekyll, a flat file website generator. You probably have heard about flat file cms, and static website generators and their advantages (simple, fast and easy to deploy).</p>

<p><strong>Checklist for the new website:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>A simple way to publish content (a blog!), and Jekyll Now offers just that.</li>
  <li>Decoupled theming system that allows me to change the website design without affecting the content</li>
  <li>Simple hosting, since I don’t need much space, database or dynamic content I didn’t want to deal with web hosting services and the monthly cost.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Whats next</strong></p>

<p>I hope to publish blog posts about UX design, side projects and any resources I found could be useful for the rest of the community.</p>

<p>So if you are reading this, let me know your thoughts.</p>
