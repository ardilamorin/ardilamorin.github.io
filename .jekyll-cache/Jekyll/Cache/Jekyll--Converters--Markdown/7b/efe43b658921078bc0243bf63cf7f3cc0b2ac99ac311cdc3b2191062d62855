<p>I moved to Madrid on 2011 and didn’t know much people in the city. I worked on digital products for some time, but I didn’t know anyone here. I tried different ways to enter the “scene” but it didn’t work out so well.</p>

<p><strong>Local events</strong></p>

<p>Madrid has its fair share of local events about Design, User Experience, Customer Experience and Digital products. Here is a list of some of those in case you are interested:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/04x10">04x10</a> (No longer active)</li>
  <li><a href="https://ladiesthatux.com/madrid/">Ladies that UX: Madrid</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.playrestart.es">Play Restart</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.meetup.com/es-ES/UX-Academy/?chapter_analytics_code=UA-55896633-1">UX Academy</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://experiencefighters.com">UX Fighters</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I attended some of these events planning to meet people, collaborate and maybe find job oportunitties in the future. Apparently most people already now each other, and after a while I noticed that there wasnt much rotation in the speakers lineup. So i stoped attending</p>

<p><strong>Other ways to network</strong></p>

<p>That doesn’t mean I gave up. I looked for other ways to stay in the loop and I decided to take the matter in my own hands. I did not start a “UX and Ribs” meetup, but I did create a group on Linkedin for UX professionals in Madrid. It’s gaining some traction and there are some job posts from time to time but people are still a bit shy when it comes to posting.</p>
