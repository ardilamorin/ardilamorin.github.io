I"ó<p>I am creating this list for my self (and for you of course) and because is a question I get often from people wanting to make the transition to UX Design. These are books that I have read and found useful. I have categorised them according to the moment your are in your career and the different roles and challenges you may face along the way.</p>

<p>Feel free to recommend new books to add to this list, and this page will be alive and updated when I discover new books that I consider to be must reads.</p>
