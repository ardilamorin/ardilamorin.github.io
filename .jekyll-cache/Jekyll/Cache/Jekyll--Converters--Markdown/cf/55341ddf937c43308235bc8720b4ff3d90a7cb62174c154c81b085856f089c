<p>The first thing to stand out in this website is that it works using github pages, powered by Jekyll, a flat file website generator. You probably have heard about flat file cms, and static website generators and their advantages. Simple, fast and easy to deploy.</p>

<h2 id="checklist-for-the-new-website">Checklist for the new website</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A simple way to publish content (a blog!), and Jekyll Now offers just that.</li>
  <li>Decoupled theming system that allows me to change the website design without affecting the content.</li>
  <li>Simple hosting, since I donâ€™t need much space, database or dynamic content I didnâ€™t want to deal with web hosting services and the monthly cost.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâ€™s next</h2>

<p>I hope to publish blog posts about UX design, side projects and any resources I found could be useful for the rest of the community.</p>

<p>So if you are reading this, let me know your thoughts.</p>
