<p>In our industry, creating digital products, professional growth and learning is determined by your formal education and experience. Experience can be a crucial factor in shaping your growth, the type of designer you will be, and finding out what is that you actually enjoy doing in our very fragmented and specialised profession.</p>

<p>As someone who has a certain level of responsibility of what projects people on my team get to do, I believe that you have to make and effort on finding the right person for the job based on the needs of the project and their skills. But (there is always a but…) if we only allow people to do what they are already good at, they probably won’t grow.</p>
