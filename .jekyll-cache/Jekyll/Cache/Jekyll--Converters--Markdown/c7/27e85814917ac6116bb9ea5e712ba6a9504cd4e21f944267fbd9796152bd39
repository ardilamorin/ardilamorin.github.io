I"<p>This the 3rd version of this site. The first version of this website was done hand-coded by me, following the instructions from Ethan Marcotte and his book Responsive Web Design. The second version was made using Jekyll-now to include a blog section to the site using the standard theme, and what you are seeing now is version 3.</p>

<p>A while a go, I read an article from Juan Martin García titled “Look Ma, no media Queries” and I was determined to try it on my website. I thought that it could be a great way to learn more about CSS grid. Also, I am a firm believer that we should design not for devices but based on the content and where it breaks, so the idea of being able to make the whole website responsive without having to worry about different device-based breakpoints sounded fantastic.</p>

<p>Before I jumped into creation mode, I first wanted to think about the redesign in terms of layout and visual style. The previous version was super basic, a 1 column layout that just grew vertically. This looked like a good opportunity to try something different and test the limits of what was possible with this “no media queries” approach.</p>

<p>This exploration mode went on for some time, and it became a form of procrastination. After a while I decided to move on, since anything different from what I had online was definitively an improvement.</p>
